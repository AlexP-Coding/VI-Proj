## IDEAS:

- Scented widgets (aka lists...pkmn id probs wont be needed)
- Barchart does not scale up for too large a  
- Divergent barchart (available choices vs player choices)
- slope graph for stats change over time
- Cleveland dotplot for stats change over time (more than 2 values, interactivity can let user choose these things)
- Stats hexagon, you can place the dots (for the average, for pokemon selected )
- Matrix diagram for type combos (maybe w heat map?)
- Parallel coordinates for stat average/selected type combination(s)?
- Boxplot for chosen stat for chosen type combo(s)? Or a distribution plot? Jitter plot (meh), if there is a high number of values?
- Compact rectangular euler diagram
- Stacked bars for type combos over stats, good to estimate average of stats but poor for individual stats (BUT can use interactivity to make sure all HP bars are aligned for example!). Percentage stacked bars are ok too.
- Small multiples
- scatterplot where bubbles have area per decil of a given for nr of pokemon
- petal glyph for stats per type combo


## NOTES
- If ur gonna make horizontal bar charts at least order them by value for easier comparison
- histograms are good 4 discrepancy
- ratio of change can be indirectly/visually derived from line chart (by the line inclination)
- bar charts work better w missing values, in x axis we have categorical/nominal, sorted by bar value
- line chart should have continuous on x axis
- areas are still shitty, and it becomes worse if it's a circle
